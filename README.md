# Prototype-Selection-for-Nearest-Neighbors
One way to speed up nearest neighbor classification is to replace the training set by a carefully chosen subset of “prototypes”. Think of a good strategy for choosing prototypes from the training set, bearing in mind that the ultimate goal is good classification performance on test data. Assume that 1-NN will be used. Then implement your algorithm, and test it on the MNIST dataset, available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html
